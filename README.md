Classifying Different type of Dances using CNN and Tranfer Learning

Used the concept of Transfer learning to classify different dances spread across 8 different classes.
Transfer Learning is used generally when data is very low.In this case we had 364 different images to classify 8 different clasees.
Till now, Achieved Training accuracy of 90% and Test Accuracy of 80.2%.

Frameworks Used: Tensorflow
Model used: Inception
Future vision: To test on various other models like RestNet50 to check for the accuracy of Test set.
